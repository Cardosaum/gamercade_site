We're slowly adding builds to our downloads page, starting with our primary development platforms: Windows 64-bit and Linux x86-64. You can find them on the [downloads](/downloads) page which has been updated.

Once we iron out a few things we will add more platforms, starting with additional Windows and Linux support. Mac support will come in the future depending on demand and/or if we can hit our support goals.

The console download also includes a packaged sample game which includes both single player and networked play.

Of course, the project is very much still in development - so expect a few bugs and weirdness here and there. If you have any feedback, definitely head on over to our [community](/community) page as its the primary way to reach out to us.

We're excited to see what happens from here!

Game on!
