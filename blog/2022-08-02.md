Gamercade is officially open source! You may have noticed the addition of the [GitHub](https://github.com/gamercade-io) at the top of the page.

After a lot of discussion, we believe that this is the best choice of action for the future of Gamercade, as we are a community driven project. By open sourcing the project, we move much of the power and direction into the hands of the community. With your help, we can make Gamercade the best it can be!

If you want to contribute to the project, consider checking any of the issues listed on official project repositories. This isn't only limited to developers! Documentation, tutorial, and example suggestions are welcome. We are happy for your contributions!
