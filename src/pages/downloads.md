# Downloads

Gamercade is currently still in development. With changes happening at a rapid pace. Because of this, we recommend building from source to stay up with the latest changes.

**Stable** Releases are generally recommended for most use cases. They are currently unavailable. Once ready, we will make stable releases and updates on a consistent schedule.

**Edge** Releases are compiled binaries taken directly from the main branch from [GitHub](https://github.com/gamercade-io/). These are likely to have issues and compatability issues between versions. This is the same as you would get from building from source manually. Consider using edge if you want the newest and actively in-development features.
